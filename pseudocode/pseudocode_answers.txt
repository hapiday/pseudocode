Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode because it helps to develop algorithms. They can brainstorm and break each step into simple, logical steps to outline the tasks before writing the actual code. Plan out the logic of an algorithm with another programmer regardless of the need to know a specific syntax.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Pseudocode is meant for humans to read rather than machines, so it won't run on the computer.

Programming Assignment
Write the problems in pseudocode.

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT a number
INPUT a second number
  IF first number is greater than second number
    RETURN first number;
  ELSE IF first number is less than second number
    RETURN second number;
  ELSE
    RETURN second number;

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INPUT an array of numbers from 1 to 100
  FOR LOOP through the array of numbers 1 to 100
    PRINT the entire array from 1 to 100
  END FOR
END

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT an array of names from the phonebook
  FOR LOOP through the array of items
    IF the item is in the array
      RETURN true;
  END FOR
END

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function searchItem(arr, item) {
  for(i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == item)
    return true;
  }
};
